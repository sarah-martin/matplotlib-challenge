Observations and Insights
1. There is a strong correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor size. It would be beneficial to see distribution of weights per regimen, to better understand if that should be taken into consideration on the drug's performance.
2. Ramicane performs statistically superior to any other regimen.
3. Despite Ceftamin and Infubinol being in the top four performing drugs, they better correlate to the rest of the regimens rather than with Ramicane and Capomulin. Ramicane and Capomulin have far superior findings than the other represented regimens.
